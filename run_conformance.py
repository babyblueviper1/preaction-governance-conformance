run_conformance.py — the conformance bar.

Asserts every fixture verifies to its DECLARED expectation:
  - the positive fixture passes all three joined suites end to end;
  - each negative fixture fails for EXACTLY ONE reason, and that reason matches its declared
    expected_failure_reason (and every other suite still passes — one broken join, not several).

Exit 0 iff the whole suite meets the bar. Run from anywhere:
