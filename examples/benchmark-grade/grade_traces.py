"""check_traces.py — independent referee grader for a submitted benchmark trace dump (S213).

General conformance-registry intake: given a JSONL of decision traces, recompute each row's verdict
from its OWN bytes and grade it in the depth vocabulary —
  CERTIFIED : the pass/fail verdict is logic-consistent AND tolerance-stable (the observed scorer
              jitter cannot flip it: |score - threshold| > jitter_margin)
  PARTIAL   : verdict is logic-consistent but sits INSIDE the jitter band (bounded by scorer
              reproducibility — the margin does not beat the row's own jitter)
  DEPTH-0   : not recomputable — an injected/observed fault (diagnosis set), or the verdict
              contradicts its own numbers (pass != score>=threshold)

Applies babyblueviper1's tolerance-stable rule EXACTLY: |score - threshold| > jitter_margin.

Referee-hard (the whole point): we do NOT run the producer's recompute.py and report its output —
we recompute independently from the bytes. We ALSO replicate the producer's own cut and report
where the two grades DIVERGE (referee-of-referees: recompute the recomputers). The score values
themselves are producer-asserted (no live scorer); CERTIFIED is a verdict-reproducibility claim,
with the model/probe digests graded separately as the reproducible-fingerprint tier.

Run (offline, bundled real sample): python3 grade_traces.py
Run against the full Correctover dump:  python3 grade_traces.py --traces /path/to/traces.jsonl
